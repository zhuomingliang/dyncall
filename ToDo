0.9:
----
- make install should install manpages
- mailing list announcements (html email?)
- fix for NDS:
    * ARM:
      - callback_plain retval wrong (not only platform)
    * THUMB:
      - ellipsis (might be test itself, not respecting fixed part of args)
      - retvals of call_suite (maybe all retvals, in general)
      - callback_plain retval
      - callf

build-system:
-------------
- cmake mac os x universal binary builds with *.S does not build 
  multiple architectures

portasm:
--------
- add solaris support for x64

dyncall:
--------
- support for return values: aggregate return values
- support for argument values: structures, half-precision, vector types, long double
- varargs for mips (might exist, but test all ABIs)
- consider automatic type-promotion for arguments passed through DC_CALL_C_ELLIPSIS_VARARGS;
  this would make it easier to just pass arguments instead of having to know about the C
  type promotions
- syscalls for x64
  * bsd
  * linux
- other syscalls


dynload:
--------
- bug: test/nm crashes on qemu mips linux o32 debian etch
- test/resolve_self crashes/asserts on windows and bsds
- rename SymsInit to InitSyms and similar for cleanup function to reflect naming
  in dyncall
- get rid of Dl_info and friends (_GNU_SOURCE) in dynload/dynload_syms_elf.c
  for implementation of dlSymsNameFromValue(..)
- check if PSP can support dynload (missing elf.h, dlfcn.h, etc.); fixup readme if successful

dyncallback:
------------
- callback_plain's return value not correct anymore on NDS (maybe just broken testcode?)
- add MIPS callbacks (thunks seem to be working, but maybe buggy)
- finish PPC32 callbacks (see bugs section, below)

bindings:
---------
- release bindings as standalone packages (already done for rbdc as a gem and rdyncall on cran)
  * add note to documentation, where bindings are and that some bindings are svn-only ATM
- add rdoc documentation to ruby gem
- bring python up to latest
- add pydoc for python
- add manpage for shdc
- expose callf-convenience functions to go
- add godoc for godc
- bring java up to latest
- add javadoc to java
- add more bindings
- add callback support for erlang, go, java, lua, python and ruby (and shell? how?)
- add call-conv-mode-support for rbdc through signature

manual:
-------
- finish tex4ht manual generation (use \ifhtml and \ifnhtml, ...)
- provide more examples on how to use dyncall, dynload and dyncallback
  * e.g. enhance manual with a couple of examples (e.g. calling MessageBoxA on windows, etc.)
- manuals for bindings (as stated in bindings-section, above)

urgent issues:
--------------
- finish SPARC/SPARC64 calling conventions in doc's callconv-appendix !!!
- Haiku/gmake build doesn't build dynload due to the fact, that elf.h is not found
  on default installations (one has to install the system headers)
  * add to doc
- Solaris/gmake build doesn't build dynload and tests anymore (maybe not even dyncallback)
- test arm32/ATPCS/THUMB (and then change Status in doc Appendix)
- look over code and fix TODO or @@@ marks
- add ppc-support to doc (both, 32 and 64, as well as little and big endian remarks)

nice to have:
-------------
- update: microsoft visual c++ build files - integrate all test suites in solution file
- consistency: on x64 platforms: make both ABIs available ('win64','sysv') for all x64 OS ports
- microsoft build enhancement: autodetect assembly via C preprocessor (like with .S gcc files)
- test/thunk: some platforms do not allow for allocation of executable code on heap and stack -- 
  currently this test will crash, maybe we should collect information which platforms allow and which not.

bugs:
-----
- callbacks on ppc32 only work on linux and apple (osx abi), but not BSD
- vararg function calls don't work for ARM THUMB mode (Daniel's new interface for modesetting for varag
  args should be used); adapt test/ellipsis and/or retest

missing implementations (descending priority):
----------------------------------------------
- itanium
- 68k, 88k, 6502, etc.
- alpha
- superh
- cell
- blackfin
- z80
- hppa
- vax
- atmel avr
- propeller
- amd29k
- arc
- seaforth

available hardware for outstanding ports:
-----------------------------------------
- 68k: Tassilo's old Palm m100 (MC68EZ328 (16MHz))
- sh4: Tassilo's Dreamcast
- sigmatel stmp3550b: Daniel's iPod Nano
